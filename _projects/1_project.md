In Correlated Data (STAT 452) I learned how to work with time series, longitudinal, and spatially correlated data, and I particularly enjoyed incorporating spatial correlation to modeling techniques. This project, we delve into the critical issue of childhood lead exposure in the Twin Cities, which can cause significant harm to a child's brain and nervous system, slow growth and development, and, in severe cases, result in comas or death. Our goal was to understand the factors contributing to elevated blood lead levels in children and pinpoint where this issue is most prominent.
