Greetings, welcome to my portfolio! I am currently a PhD Student in Statistics at Rice University! Before, I graduated from Macalester College with a double major in Economics (Honors) and worked in economic consulting in Washington D.C. I am particularly interested in Causal Inference, Dependent Data, and Graphical Models. Outside of school, I enjoy weightlifting, hiking, and skiing!
