Welcome to my portfolio. I am a PhD student in Statistics at Rice University, with a Bachelorâ€™s degree in Economics (Honors) and Applied Mathematics from Macalester College. My research interests include Causal Inference, Dependent Data, and Statistical Learning. Prior to starting at Rice, I worked in economic consulting and finance, where I applied advanced statistical methods to address complex challenges. Outside of my academic work, I enjoy weightlifting, hiking, and skiing.
