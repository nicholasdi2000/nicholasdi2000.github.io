Greetings, and welcome to my portfolio! I am currently a PhD Student in Statistics at Rice University. Previously, I graduated from Macalester College with a double major in Economics (Honors) and Applied Math. My research interests include Causal Inference, Dependent Data, and Graphical Models. Outside of academia, I am a certified NASM personal trainer and enjoy weightlifting, hiking, and skiing.
